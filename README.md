# String Reverse

In this assignment, you'll design and implement one of the string manipulation functions.
Remember that a string is an array of characters. Algorithms that worked on array data structure will work on strings as well.

## Exercise

* Design and implement a method to reverse a string *in place*. The method takes the string to be reversed as input parameter.
* Above the method, elaborate the comment to share the time and space complexity of your method.
  * Your solution should optimize the space complexity as much as possible. In other words, do not use any more space than needed.
  * If you explain the complexity in terms of *n*, be sure to explain what *n* stands for.
* For example, if the method is called with input parameter of "*Lovelace*", the method should update the input string object to have the value "*ecalevoL*".
* <b>Notes</b>: 
  * Do not use Ruby provided functionality for `.reverse` and `.reverse!`.
  * You may use `.length` method available in the String class.
  * You may access a character at a given index or set the value at a given index.
